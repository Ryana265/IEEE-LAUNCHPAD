#### Leadership and Influence:

- I meet the requirements for being a leader or influencer in my domain through my proactive involvement in various tech communities and leading several projects. One clear example of my leadership skills is my role as the Vice Chair of IEEE SB SJCET, where I focused on maintaining a balanced  workload within our team, which not only prevented burnout but also encouraged teamwork and collaboration. I also emphasized the importance of technical development and knowledge-sharing, balancing academic and non-academic activities.

- As the Link PIE representative of IEEE Kerala Section and Vice-Chair of IEEE SB SJCET, I coordinated and facilitated effective communication and collaboration between IEEE Kerala Section and SJCET. I represented the interests and concerns of IEEE SB SJCET at the sectional level and actively engaged with IEEE Kerala Section activities, contributing to the overall development and success of the section.

- As the Talks Manager of PIE, I spearheaded the creation of PIEPODS, a talk series available on Spotify, which allowed us to reach a wider audience and provide valuable insights through engaging discussions. Additionally, I curated VOICE-IT content on YouTube, further expanding our reach and enabling visual engagement.

#### Networking:

- I have strong networking skills, which I have developed through active participation in tech conferences, workshops, and online forums. I plan to engage with the community by attending local meetups, contributing to discussions on platforms like Stack Overflow and GitHub, and collaborating on projects with other developers. By sharing my knowledge and experiences, I aim to influence and lead others in the field of full stack web development, encouraging a collaborative and innovative environment.

#### Career Plan:

- Currently, I am gaining valuable experience as an intern in full stack web development. My immediate plan is to continue honing my skills and gaining practical experience in this role. I aim to explore various aspects of full stack development, including frontend and backend technologies, to deepen my expertise.In the longer term, I aspire to take on more challenging projects and responsibilities within the field. I plan to leverage my experience to contribute effectively to innovative projects and startups within the Kerala Startup Ecosystem. By continually learning and adapting to new technologies and industry trends, I aim to grow as a proficient full stack developer and make significant contributions to the tech community.

Would you like to include any specific details or adjustments to this plan?

#### Thoughts on Kerala's Tech Ecosystem:

- Kerala has immense potential to excel in the Technology Startup Ecosystem. With its high literacy rate and a growing number of engineering graduates, the state has a strong talent pool. To thrive, Kerala needs to focus on building better infrastructure, providing funding opportunities for startups, and fostering a culture of innovation and collaboration. By leveraging its unique strengths and addressing these areas, Kerala can become a leading tech hub in India.


#### Highly Visible Technical Content:

- I have authored a journal article detailing our FarmSage project, focusing on its innovative use of AI and IoT in agriculture. This work was recognized with the Best Paper Presentation Award at the SPICE International Conference held by MBITS, Kothamangalam. The paper highlights our research findings and contributions to advancing agricultural technology through data-driven solutions.
